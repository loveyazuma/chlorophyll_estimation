# Chlorophyll Estimation Using Linear and KNN Regeression
Estimation of the chlorophyll content from a hyperspectral image using linear regression and K-NN regression 


### Processes
- The data was read in and the histogram of chlorophyll was visualized
- A train/test split was performed for training and testing the models
- The data was normalized and a linear model was applied after normalization
- The coefficients of the linear model were visualized and a scatter plot created
- The optimal number of neighbors was identified and applied to the KNN model and a scatter plot was visualized
- The regression models were applied to the hyperspectral image and values were predicted
